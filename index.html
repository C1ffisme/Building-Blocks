      <p>Building Blocks is a small, two dimensional environment that mimics Terraria. While it is empty, and in need of features, we currently have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Map Generation (With hills, biomes and trees)</li>
<li>A 'Survival Mode'</li>
<li>A few different kinds of blocks</li>
<li>A crafting menu</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>Building Blocks is coded in python and pygame, which means even an amateur programmer or bored teenager can easily fiddle around with the code.</p>

<p>As a game, Building Blocks is not complete, however, our <a href="https://github.com/C1ffisme/Building-Blocks">Github Page</a> is open for people to submit pull requests and issues. Please help us there!</p>
