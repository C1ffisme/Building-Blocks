This game is not complete yet. And will probably never be. 

You are going to need Python and the python modules pygame, random,sys,time, and json.

There is no advanced compiling or building needed. Just download this and type the commands in a terminal:

- cd /where/you/put/the/folder/Building\ Blocks/
- python main.py

Or open main.py in IDLE or geany and run it.
